<p>These are some basic security practices everyone should folow: </p>
    <h2>Create Strong, Unique Passwords:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Generate passwords unrelated to personal information.</li>
        <li>Change your passwords on a regular basis.</li>
        <li>Never reuse the same password across multiple accounts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Keep Software Updated:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure your operating system, software, and apps are always current.</li>
        <li>Apply the latest security patches promptly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Utilize Firewall and Antivirus Software:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Employ a firewall to block unauthorized access to your computer.</li>
        <li>Install and maintain updated antivirus software to identify and remove malware.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Limit Sharing Personal Information:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Exercise caution when sharing personal details online.</li>
        <li>Avoid excessive sharing of private information on social media.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practice Email Security:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Exercise prudence when handling email attachments and links from unfamiliar senders.</li>
        <li>Refrain from clicking on suspicious email links or downloading attachments from untrusted sources.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Regularly Back Up Your Data:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Create frequent backups of important files and data.</li>
        <li>In case of data loss or a cyberattack, having backups ensures you can recover your information.</li>
    </ul>
        <P>For me, using a password manager is a good way to improve security but a practice which can be considered an above average Joe. It can be hard to remember many strong and unique passwords, so a password manager can help you generate and store them all in one place. It can also automatically fill in your passwords when you need them, which is convenient.

Some people still use their memory or write down their passwords, but this is not as secure. A password manager is a more secure way to handle your login credentials.</P>
