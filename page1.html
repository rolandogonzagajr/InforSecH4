    </ul>

    <h2>1.2 STEGANOGRAPHY</h2>
    <p>Schneier defines steganography as a way to hide secret messages in other messages, such that the secret's very existence is concealed.</p>

    <h2>1.3 SUBSTITUTION CIPHERS AND TRANSPOSITION CIPHERS</h2>
    <p>A substitution cipher is one in which each character in the plaintext is substituted for another character in the ciphertext. The receiver inverts the substitution on the ciphertext to recover the plaintext.</p>
    <p>There are four types of substitution ciphers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Monoalphabetic substitution ciphers:</strong> In this type of cipher, each letter of the plaintext is replaced with a single, fixed letter of the ciphertext. The Caesar cipher is a simple example of a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. The Caesar cipher uses a shift of 3, while ROT13 uses a shift of 13. This means that A in the plaintext becomes D in the ciphertext for the Caesar cipher, and N in the plaintext becomes W in the ciphertext for ROT13.</li>
        <li><strong>Polyalphabetic substitution ciphers:</strong> In this type of cipher, multiple substitution tables are used. This makes it more difficult for an attacker to break the cipher, as they would need to know all of the substitution tables.</li>
        <li><strong>Homophonic substitution ciphers:</strong> In this type of cipher, multiple letters of the plaintext can be mapped to the same letter of the ciphertext. This makes it even more difficult for an attacker to break the cipher.</li>
        <li><strong>Autokey ciphers:</strong> In this type of cipher, the key is generated from the plaintext itself. This makes it very difficult for an attacker to guess the key.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In a transposition cipher, the plaintext remains the same, but the order of characters is shuffled around. In a simple columnar transposition cipher, the plaintext is written horizontally onto a piece of graph paper of fixed width, and the ciphertext is read off vertically.</p>

             <h2>1.4 SIMPLE XOR</h2>
    <p>Schneier describes XOR (exclusive OR) as a basic binary operation represented by '^' in C or in mathematical notation. It has the following characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>XOR operation results in 0 when applied to two 0s or two 1s.</li>
        <li>It yields 1 when applied to a 0 and a 1, or vice versa.</li>
        <li>When XOR is applied to a value 'a' and itself, the result is always 0.</li>
        <li>Repeated XOR with the same value 'b' on the result of 'a XOR b' will revert the result back to 'a'.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Schneier points out that the simple-XOR algorithm is essentially a Vigenère polyalphabetic cipher and is considered somewhat primitive in the world of cryptography. Despite its simplicity, it was prevalent in commercial software packages, particularly those in the MS-DOS and Macintosh environments. When encountering software claiming to have a "proprietary" encryption algorithm that is significantly faster than DES (Data Encryption Standard), it is likely to be some variant of the simple-XOR algorithm.</p>

    <h2>1.5 ONE-TIME PADS</h2>
    <p>Classically, a one-time pad is nothing more than a large nonrepeating set of truly random key letters, written on sheets of paper, and glued together in a pad. The scheme is perfectly secure as long as the key sequence is truly random and never reused. However, practical challenges include generating and securely distributing random key sequences, ensuring perfect synchronization between sender and receiver, and the key length must match the message length.</p>

    <h2>1.6 COMPUTER ALGORITHMS</h2>
    <p>There are many cryptographic algorithms. These are three of the most common:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>DES (Data Encryption Standard):</strong> DES is the most popular computer encryption algorithm. DES is a U.S. and international standard. It is a symmetric algorithm; the same key is used for encryption and decryption.</li>
        <li><strong>RSA (named for its creators—Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman):</strong> RSA is the most popular public-key algorithm. It can be used for both encryption and digital signatures.</li>
        <li><strong>DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm, used as part of the Digital Signature Standard):</strong> DSA is another public-key algorithm. It cannot be used for encryption, but only for digital signatures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.7 LARGE NUMBERS</h2>
    <p>Schneier provides a table (Table 1.1) that offers physical analogues to help readers grasp the scale and significance of various large numbers used in cryptography. These numbers are approximations and are sourced from a variety of references. Here are some key analogues and numbers presented in the table:</p>
